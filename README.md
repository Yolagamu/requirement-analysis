# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction
This repository is dedicated to exploring **Requirement Analysis** in the context of software development.  
It serves as a guide to understand the process of gathering, analyzing, and validating requirements to ensure that software systems meet user needs and business goals.

## What is Requirement Analysis?
**Requirement Analysis** is the process of identifying, understanding, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system.  
It is a critical phase in the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** because it ensures that the final product aligns with user needs, reduces errors, and minimizes costly changes later in development.  
Key goals include:  
- Understanding the problem domain  
- Defining functional and non-functional requirements  
- Establishing clear acceptance criteria for features  

---

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
Requirement Analysis is crucial for several reasons:  
1. **Defines Project Scope** – Helps in establishing clear boundaries and prevents scope creep.  
2. **Improves Communication** – Provides a shared understanding between stakeholders, developers, and designers.  
3. **Reduces Costs and Risks** – Identifies potential issues early, minimizing rework and ensuring quality delivery.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
The main activities include:  
- **Requirement Gathering** – Collecting needs and expectations from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, and workshops.  
- **Requirement Elicitation** – Refining and elaborating on requirements using techniques like brainstorming, observation, and prototyping.  
- **Requirement Documentation** – Creating detailed documents, specifications, and use cases to communicate requirements clearly.  
- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling** – Structuring requirements, identifying dependencies, and modeling workflows.  
- **Requirement Validation** – Reviewing requirements with stakeholders to ensure completeness, correctness, and feasibility.

## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements
Functional requirements define **what the system should do**. Examples for a booking management system include:  
- User Registration and Login  
- Property Search and Filtering  
- Booking and Checkout Process  

### Non-functional Requirements
Non-functional requirements define **how the system should perform**. Examples include:  
- Page load time under 2 seconds  
- Secure payment processing  
- System availability of 99.9%

## Use Case Diagrams
**Use Case Diagrams** visually represent the interactions between users (actors) and the system.  
**Benefits:**  
- Helps stakeholders understand system functionality  
- Clarifies the roles of users and their interactions  
- Assists in identifying functional requirements  

**Example for Booking System:**

## Acceptance Criteria
**Acceptance Criteria** define the conditions a feature must satisfy to be accepted by stakeholders.  
**Importance:**  
- Ensures clarity on expected behavior  
- Provides measurable conditions for testing  
- Reduces misunderstandings between stakeholders and developers  

**Example:** Checkout Feature  
- User must be able to select a payment method (Credit Card, PayPal)  
- Total booking cost is calculated accurately  
- User receives booking confirmation and receipt via email
